The Size of Anything allows users to compare teh sizes of different areas on a map. For example, the user can type "Disneyland", and the resulting area in OpenStreetMap will be returned to be displayed on the map. Then, that area can be relocated when the user drags their mouse.

There are a couple methods the user can do this. They can search the name of an area, use the magic wand (click on the map to search for areas that contain that coordinate), create their own custom area (of size x kilometers squared, or of y length), or place an area they've placed before from the history tab.
