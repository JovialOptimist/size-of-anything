These are some high-level and low-level tasks that need to get done at some point

Settings Menu

- Option for markers to be always on
- Adjust size of markers
- Adjust when markers appear (the ratio of polygon size to map size)
- Dark Mode
- Delete history

Make a "hide markers" button on the map like a leaflet control.

Implement an easter egg: searching "anything" finds a completely random OSM object

The custom shapes are vaguely off-center with the map. Although, this is dependent on the panel being open or closed. If it's closed, then it's technically totally fine. But when it's open, it can be jarring having each object be placed vaguely to the left of where you might expect it.

The whale still has pants for some reason.
