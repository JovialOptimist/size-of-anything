These are some high-level and low-level tasks that need to get done at some point

Settings Menu

- Option for markers to be always on
- Adjust size of markers
- Adjust when markers appear (the ratio of polygon size to map size)
- Dark Mode
- Delete history

Make a "hide markers" button on the map like a leaflet control.

Weird bug : after a shape is deleted, some other shapes can't be moved. Also their active element display never appears.
